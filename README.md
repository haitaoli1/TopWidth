# TopWidth
Mathematica Package to calculate the top decay width with NNLO corrections  in QCD and NLO corrections in EW. 

# Requirement 
The HPL package is required to generate the numerics of the function HPL, which can be download from https://krone.physik.uzh.ch/data/HPL/ 

Plase set the path "$HPLPath="the:\path\of\the\installation"Â  and make sure Mathematica can initialise the code through "<<HPL`"

# Download
Download the package through 
git clone https://github.com/haitaoli1/TopWidth.git

go to the directory TopWidth, run the example notebook

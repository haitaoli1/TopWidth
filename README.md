# TopWidth
Mathematica Package to calculate the top decay width with NNLO corrections  in QCD and NLO corrections in EW. 

# Requirement 
The HPL package is required to generate the numerics of the harmonic polylogarithm, which can be download from https://krone.physik.uzh.ch/data/HPL/ 

Please make sure Mathematica can initialize the code through "\<\<HPL`". If not plase  set the path "$HPLPath="the:\path\of\the\installation".

# Download
Download the package through 

git clone https://github.com/haitaoli1/TopWidth.git

go to the directory TopWidth, run the example notebook "example.nb". 

# Contacts
If you have any problem, contact Haitao Li by haitao.li@sdu.edu.cn.
